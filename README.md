Next steps:

While learning Vue.js, I realized how important it is to write better documentations and decided to pick up Markdown.

Naturally, this feels like the right thing to build.

Next steps:

1. Complete more regex filters
2. Make text area more responsive
3. Integrate file output abililty
4. Integrate with Github?
